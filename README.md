# Anup polymer

Build a clone of this website https://shop.polymer-project.org/

### The website should have 5 pages:

- Home Page
- Item listing page
- Single Item Page
- Cart Page (hard code the items in the cart)
- Checkout Page

### Instructions:

- Apply a mobile-first approach.
- Use a CSS reset
- Add README.md and .gitignore files to your repository. Make regular commits
- Make a common styles.css. Include it on each HTML page. Put the style classes here. They can be gradually reused.
- Work page by page, section by section, element by element. Break things down to the smallest step.
- Ask yourself what you don't know and figure it out.
- Get the project reviewed from time to time if you are not sure about something.
